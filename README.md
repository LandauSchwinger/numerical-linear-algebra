# numerical-linear-algebra

My Journey to better understand of the basis of modern ML and DL - numerical linear algebra.

## Trefethen Bau book

Here will be solutions and some experiments with demonstrated inside the book algorithms.

In progress..

### Python instead of matlab

I find python3 with numpy and jupyter notebook a much more convenient and portable. Matlab users
will see in python/numpy familiar interfaces.

Create and start your virtual [environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for the project. Python version for the project is 3.8.10. Don't test now on other versions.

Do:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enjoy.
